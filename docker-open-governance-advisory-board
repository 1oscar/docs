DOCKER OPEN GOVERNANCE ADVISORY BOARD
This morning, the Docker project leadership [announced](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140430005529/en/Open-Source-Docker-Project-Announces-Open-Governance) a proposal for a Docker Governance Advisory Board (or DGAB), as a next step towards a fully open governance model for [Docker](http://docker.io/).

美国太平洋时间4月30日早上， Docker 项目领导团队 [提议](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140430005529/en/Open-Source-Docker-Project-Announces-Open-Governance) 成立 Docker Governance Advisory Board （ Docker 管理咨询委员会，简称 DGAB ），进而打造一个完全开放的 Docker(http://docker.io) 管理模型。 

The short story is that the Docker Governance Advisory Board will provide input to the Docker project leadership on a broad range of topics, including the project roadmap, policies and procedures around contribution, core criteria for Docker-compliant products, and the long term governance structure of the Docker project. Membership on the advisory board will be open to individuals, corporations and users alike, and will be determined transparently by code contribution and other objective factors. No sponsorship or fee will be required to join the advisory board. Board membership criteria and selection, and all output from board meetings, will be made public.

Docker 管理咨询委员会将在包括项目路线图、贡献者政策与流程、 Docker 衍生产品的核心标准、 Docker 项目的长期管理结构等广泛的议题中为 Docker 项目管理团队提供建议与咨询。管理咨询委员会面向个人、企业和用户开放，基于代码贡献和其他客观因素公开决定。加入委员会无需任何赞助或费用。成员资格的标准和选举由委员会会议作出并公示。

The full text of our proposal is available at http://docker.io/governance. We will be taking feedback and comments on the proposal, as well as nominations for membership, over the next three weeks. However, I’d like to explain a little bit about what we are hoping to accomplish with the DGAB.

完整的提议内容可以在 http://docker.io/governance 查看。接下来的三周内，在我们将就此提议接收反馈和评论，同时也欢迎提名成员名单。我也乐意在这里说明成立 DGAB 的愿景。

##WHY WE ARE FORMING THE BOARD

##为什么要成立委员会


In the 13 months since the Docker project launched, Docker – and the ecosystem around it – have experienced phenomenal growth. As of today, we have over [400 contributors](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/graphs/contributors) to the project, over 11,000 “Dockerized” apps in the library, and Docker containers have been downloaded over 1.5 M times. More than just a project, Docker has become an ecosystem and, increasingly, a platform on which thousands of organizations and individuals are building and making long term bets.

自从 Docker 项目启动已有13个月， Docker 以及围绕其建立的生态系统已经取得了惊人的成长。截至目前，我们在 Github 上已有超过 [400名贡献者](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/graphs/contributors) ，在库中有超过 11,000 个“ Dockerized ”的应用，而 Docker 容器也下载超过一百五十万次。 Docker 不仅只是个项目，而是发展成为一个生态系统，一个由成千上万个组织和个人搭建起来的平台。

There are now over [5,500 projects](https://github.com/search?q=docker&ref=cmdform) on GitHub with the word “Docker” in their title. A wide range of companies have announced integration of Docker into their products. And, an increasing number of organizations are building Docker into the plans for their next generation data centers. While we’re very proud of how “open” Docker is already, we wanted to make sure that we provided the people and organizations who are making a long-term bet on Docker with a way to provide coordinated input into the future of Docker.

##WHAT WILL THE BOARD DO
The primary purpose of the DGAB is to advise the Docker project leadership on matters related to supporting the long term governance, structure, and roadmap of the Docker project.

The following main areas are included in this charter:

1. Provide a forum for individuals, users, and companies to discuss the issues and formulate recommendations for those issues.
2. Provide guidance and input to the project’s leadership, and where possible, present a consistent and consolidated opinion from the broader Docker community.
3. Produce a formal, twice yearly, report to the project leadership and broader Docker community of the status of and progress made in all areas under the purview of the DGAB.
4. Promote and support the use of Docker in manner consistent with Guiding Principles of the project and the Core Criteria.

###SOME GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR THE DESIGN OF THE BOARD
In designing the initial proposal,  we looked carefully at a number of other governance approaches. While we found things that we liked and didn’t like in almost every model (in general, we really like the Linux Kernel model), we think that Docker is at a unique stage in its lifecycle, and we want to craft a model that is appropriate for where we are as a project. Here are some of the considerations:

####1) First, do no harm. Make sure governance stays both open and effective
As mentioned above, we designed Docker to be a very open project from the outset. We use one of the most permissive licenses (Apache 2.0). We encourage broad participation (over 95% of contributors don’t work for Docker, Inc., including some of the core maintainers). We have an open design philosophy, use a common set of open tools for all contributions & contributors, and use the lightweight DCO process, rather than requiring CLAs.

Partially as a result, we’ve gotten very broad-based participation in Docker as a project, and a huge amount of momentum in the ecosystem as the whole. The project itself is advancing at an amazing clip (66 releases comprising over 7700 commits in the past year), and the last thing we want to do is weigh the project down with bureaucracy.

As a result, we are not looking to create a foundation or governance board now.  The project leadership (including Docker creator and chief maintainer [Solomon Hykes](https://twitter.com/solomonstre) and the core maintainer team), will continue to set the priorities and make the final decisions about the direction of the project. But, the advisory group will provide a strong, coordinated, and public voice for the project’s important constituencies. We should also make it clear that the DGAB is intended to enhance – and not substitute for – the current mechanisms for community input. We are committed to open governance and effective governance. We think this step strikes the right balance for this stage of the project.

####2) Do things in the open
The proposal and documentation behind the DGAB, the selection criteria & process, and the output of meetings will all be public and available for comment.

####3) Represent the various constituencies
The DGAB has seats reserved for the various constituencies who are making long term investments in Docker, this includes:

The individuals who are investing time and effort to contribute to the project.
Users who are deploying Docker (and providing use cases describing their experiences).
Companies that are incorporating Docker into their products and services.
####4) Contribute-to-play vs. pay-to-play
Membership on the DGAB (and influence on the project in general), comes from contribution. There is no fee to join the board. The top contributors (and maintainers) are automatically given a seat on the board. Companies can only get on the board if they are both top contributors and agree to implement Docker-based solutions in a manner consistent with the project as a whole.

####5) Keep the project and ecosystem self sustaining
Beyond the effort needed in the code base itself, the Docker ecosystem as a whole needs investment: to maintain a large index of publicly available Docker images, to produce training materials, to on-board and enable derivative projects, to enforce trademarks, etc. We think that this long-term investment is better assured under the current project leadership/ownership than by making the project dependent on financial donations.

####6) Create a level playing field, avoid “Docker washing”
If Docker is to be an effective platform, we think it is important that projects that use the Docker trademark adhere to certain core criteria. We want the DGAB and the community as a whole to help define the specifics of these criteria. General items that we think are important to discuss include: use of standard APIs, consistent behaviors expected of Docker containers, trademark guidelines, provenance, upstream contribution models, and alternative distributions.

##IN CONCLUSION
We’d really like to thank the members of the community, as well as corporate partners like IBM, Rackspace, and Red Hat, who have provided guidance and support throughout this process. As a reminder, we are looking for comments on the proposal itself, as well as nominations for membership. For more detail, please go to docker.io/governance.
